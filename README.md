### PROBLEM:
You have been hired by Bruno, aka, Hair Force One, yep that's his nickname since he always has the perfect hair and burly beard. Bruno has a consulting company that focuses on custom build mobile applications for iOS and Android. Bruno's new client is Keiko Corp., an Italian food and travel company. Their employees are paid to travel and sample food around the globe. Their job is to share their experiences for Keiko Food and Travel channel. How cool is that?

So, what are the requirements? The mobile application needs to record each journal entry with a review description, attach photo's, record location and sync data via Cloud. Keiko Corp. needs to release both iOS and Android apps and updates at the same time. They need the User Interface and User Experience to be exactly the same to show the company's branding. Bruno's company is used to building iOS apps with two different code bases, one for iOS and one for Android. This causes a big problem because of the development timeline constraints and additional development cost of assigning at least two developers, one for each project.

### SOLUTION:
Flutter framework, Dart Language, Firebase Authentication, Firestore Database, Cloud Storage and Location Services to the rescue!!! With Flutter, you'll be able to build beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. You'll be able to build applications for mobile, web, desktop and embedded apps. The Flutter framework is used by the biggest companies in the world, Google, eBay, BMW, Toyota, Groupon, MGM Resorts, Philips hue and so on.

Now that we have chosen the development path, how do we create new users, authenticate them, separate data by each user, and sync the data via Cloud Worldwide? How do we attach photos to each journal entry? How do we obtain the location for each entry? You'll use Firebase Authentication to create new users, validate them, and authenticate login by user. You'll create a fully scalable Firestore database to handle storing data separated by users.  To store each photo you'll use Cloud Storage, also separated by users. To record the user's location at time of review, you'll use Location Services to obtain the GPS location, and Reverse Geocoding to retrieve the street address, city, state, zip, country. All of our requirements are fulfilled by using Flutter, Dart, Firebase Authentication, Firestore Database, Cloud Storage, and Location Services.
